# Synesthesia-Capstone
> Nikki Wood | Spring 2021

## Background
Chromesthesia, also known as sound-to-color synesthesia, is a rare phenomenon in which an indivudal perceives non-visual stimulus visually. For example, they  may hear a song and see a specific color; they may observe someone's personality as specific scenery in their head; or they may recount their emotions visually, such as excitement being described as an electric blue.

## Project Description

Because synesthesia is not identical for every person, the goal of this project is to create an AI to see if it can learn and replicate the synesthetic responses of one young adult woman. 
The test subject will listen to 300 30-second intervals of songs from different genres and then record her synesthetic responses as they relate to three categories: luminosity, color, and texture. 

> **Luminosity** refers to the brightness of the color and quantity of light. Some colors may appear muted, while others are bright and vibrant. This value will simply be recorded as either *Yes* or *No*.

> **Color** will be broken into 11 options: *Red*, *Orange*, *Yellow*, *Green*, *Blue*, *Purple*, *Pink*, *Black*, *White*, *Gray*, and *Brown*. 

> **Texture** also supports the overall impression of a color. Texture categories will be *Sparkly*, *Spiky*, *Woody*, *Smoky*, *Smooth*, *Soft*, and *None*.
