# Synesthesia-Capstone
> Nikki Wood | Spring 2021

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create an AI to learn and replicate the synesthetic responses of one young adult woman. 
This AI will be trained for three categories (luminosity, color, and texture). After being trained, the user should be able to input a 30 second song sample; 
the AI will analyze the sample and output a prediction for the client's synesthetic response.

> **Luminosity** refers to the brightness of the color and quantity of light. Some colors may appear muted, while others are bright and vibrant. This value will simply be recorded as either *Yes* or *No*.

> **Color** will be broken into 11 options: *Red*, *Orange*, *Yellow*, *Green*, *Blue*, *Purple*, *Pink*, *Black*, *White*, *Gray*, and *Brown*. 

> **Texture** also supports the overall impression of a color. Texture categories will be *Sparkly*, *Spiky*, *Woody*, *Smoky*, *Smooth*, *Soft*, and *None*.
