## Background
Chromesthesia, also known as sound-to-color synesthesia, is a rare phenomenon in which an indivudal perceives non-visual stimulus visually. For example, they  may hear a song and see a specific color; they may observe someone's personality as specific scenery in their head; or they may recount their emotions visually, such as excitement being described as an electric blue.

## Project Description

Because synesthesia is not identical for every person, the goal of this project is to create an AI to learn and replicate the synesthetic responses of one young adult woman. 

The test subject will listen to 300 20-second intervals of songs from different genres and then record her synesthetic responses as they relate to three categories: luminosity, color, and texture. 

> **Luminosity** refers to the brightness of the color and quantity of light. Some colors may appear muted, while others are bright and vibrant. This value will simply be recorded as either *Yes* or *No*.

> **Color** will be broken into 11 options: *Red*, *Orange*, *Yellow*, *Green*, *Blue*, *Purple*, *Pink*, *Black*, *White*, *Gray*, and *Brown*. 

> **Texture** also supports the overall impression of a color. Texture categories will be *Sparkly*, *Spiky*, *Woody*, *Smoky*, *Smooth*, *Soft*, and *None*.

These responses will act as the training set for the AI. Since each combination will mean something entirely different to our subject, we will end up with 154 (2 * 11 * 7) possible responses. 

*\*If there are any combinations that have no recorded samples, we may need to actively search for a song sample to represent this combination, so that there is at least one example of each possible response.*

After the AI has been trained, we should be able to give it a song sample and expect an accurate prediction for what our test subject's response would be for each category when listening to the same sample.

Afterwards, a program will be written in Python to combine the results of each category into a 'final answer' of what the subject's response will be to that song. 

## Project Concentration
This project will show competencies in the **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Engineering**. 

### Artificial Intelligence
This project will be using deep learning and other intelligent technologies in order to find the trends and correlations between music and our test subject's synesthetic responses. 

### Software Engineering
Detailed documentation on how to use the application, how it works, and what the results mean will be an integral part of this project. Applying a process model and requirement model will give me more exposure and familiarity to the Software Engineering Process and will prepare me for the field after graduation. 

## Objectives

### Main
  - Reflect on the goal of finding the expected outcome for each category with 50% accuracy
  - Application compiles each expected outcome and returns the 'correct answer' as one response (command line)
  - Minimum of 12 hours of research (Neural nets, similar AI projects, python application with AI, etc.)  
  - Find at least 1 sample recorded for each combination
  - Reflect on the expansion of my knowledge and comprehension of Python
  - Keep detailed documentation throughout the process

### Secondary
  - Reflect on the goal of finding the expected outcome for each category with 70% accuracy
  - GUI to choose a song & get display result (color)
  - Written report of research done

### Tertiary
  - Reflect on the goal of finding the expected outcome for each category with 90% accuracy
  - Gui diplays resulting color with lumosity and texture
  - Publication of results

### Submissible Items
  - Code generated for application
  - Accuracy Report
  - Excel sheet of songs and combination responses
  - Reflection(s) of accuracy goals and knowledge expansion
  - Final Presentation
  - Research report (Secondary)
  - Result report for publication (Tertiary)
