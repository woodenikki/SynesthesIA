# Process Development Approach and Justifcation

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning work-flow processes are reflective of the Waterfall Process, as activities and phases are linear. (Gather Data → Enter Data → Process Data → Generate Insights). This means that a waterfall-like process model will be the most effective for this project. 

## Process Model: V-Model

Because in the waterfall model, testing only starts after implementation is completed, it may get confusing and complicated with the scope of this capstone project. The solution to this is to use the **V-Model**, where there is a corresponding testing phase after each phase of development.

| Phase | Activities performed|
| --- | --- |
| Requirement Gathering Stage| Gather details, goals, and specifications of the final product from the client. | 
| Design Stage | Select programming language and other resources that will be beneficial to this project.  | 
| Build Stage | Training the AI, tweaking the AI parameters, and coding the actual software. |
| Testing Stage | Test the AI and software to verify they perform as specified by the client.  |
| Deployment Stage | Deploy the application in the respective environment |
