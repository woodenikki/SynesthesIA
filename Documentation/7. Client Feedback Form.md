## Tell Us More

### What designs/features do you like/dislike about the software?

    I like this software because my best friend made it and she is amazing at things, I don't like that there aren't pretty pictures

### What designs/features would you improve?

    I would improve the lack of pretty pictures 

### Any additional feedback?

    Logically, I can see why the computer thinks the way it does. My major points would be that some of the audio files were a little scratchy which might attribute to different values and a computer doesnt have an emotional response which is also a factor (plus my personal likes and dislikes), so for you to be even a percent above half is incredible!
    (Because you're trying to get something inhuman to elicit a human response thats weird even for humans)
    She is amazing, give her a good grade
